# Stop reading, start doing!

***There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path***

* **Actively write code**

	Write your own code, show it to the world, and be humiliated by all the horrible mistakes you will inevitably make.

* **Gain skills**

	Hack in an organized and systematic way.

* **Break code**

	Find bugs yourself but also follow along what the others find

* **Read code written by others**

	Every great novelist has read many many books written by other novelists 

* **Study exploits**

	You will learn a lot about OS internals

* **Share knowledge**

	* Learn from preparing a presentation (uncover hidden corners of a topic)
	* Learn from the audience (questions, comments, discussions)

* **Collaborate to open source projects**

	* Be part of the open source community
	* Learn how git and other versioning tools work
	* Learn how to write effective documentation

* **Create your own projects**

	Sharpen your coding skills, meet new people, give back to the infosec community and eventually get noted.	

* **Network with the pros**

	Partecipate to conferences, hackatons and CTFs

# Attitude

* **Ask for help**

	Make it as easy as possible for people to help you (well-scoped question with sufficient context and no typos)

* ***What if* breakpoint**

	Ask yourself "what if assumption X does not hold true?" every step along the way
