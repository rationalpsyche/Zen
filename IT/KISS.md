# Keep It Simple Stupid

* **Modularity:** write simple parts connected by clean interfaces

	*Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming*

* **Clarity is better than cleverness**

	Buying a small increase in performance with a large increase in the complexity and obscurity of your technique is a bad trade â€” not merely because complex code is more likely to harbor bugs, but also because complex code will be harder to read for future maintainers

* **Composition:** design programs to be connected to other programs

* **Separation:** separate policy from mechanism, interfaces from engines
* **Simplicity:** add complexity just where you must
* **Transparency:** to make inspection and debugging easier

	A software system is *transparent* when you can look at it and immediately understand what it is doing and how. It is *discoverable* when it has facilities for monitoring and display of its internal state.

* **Fold knowledge into data**

	Choose complexity in data rather than complexity in code

* **Least surprise:** in interface design do the least surprising thing
* **Repair:** when you must fail be noisy and fail as soon as possible
* **Optimization:** prototype before polishing. Get it working before optimizing it

	*Premature optimization is the root of all evil* - D. Knuth

	Using prototyping to learn which features you don't have to implement helps optimization for performance; you don't have to optimize what you don't write. The most powerful optimization tool in existence may be the delete key.

* **Extensibility:** design for the future

# Code design

* **Re-use:** if someone has already solved a problem once, don't let pride or politics suck you into solving it a second time rather than re-using 

* **Re-write:** you often don't really understand the problem until after the first time you implement a solution. So if you want to get it right, be ready to start over at least once

* **Minimalism:** perfection [in design] is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but rather when there is nothing more to take away

* **Community involvement:** while coding is a solitary activity, the really great hacks come from harnessing the attention and brainpower of entire communities

* **Innovation:** Have a lot of ideas and take them beyond where the originators thought they could go
