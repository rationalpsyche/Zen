# Work smarter, not harder

## Focus on systems instead of goals

We are taught to pursue goals like get good grades or be promoted at a job but often most goals are out of control. In a system instead your focus is on all the parts that you control.

A system can be thought as a *repeatable process*. Running a marathon is a goal, running 4 days a week for half an hour is a repeatable process. Losing 10 kgs is a goals, opting for a healthy diet every meal is a sytem.

This leads to the compound effect

## Leverage the compound effect

Compound interest is a concept from economy which refers to the addition of interest to the main initial deposit: a 10% growth rate on an initial 100â‚¬ deposit will yield 110,121,133 euros every month.

There are many applications to the compound effect, think about knowledge, as you increase in skills the faster you are in performing tasks.

## Measure output, not input

Writing daily with no objective is just practice. If you want to achieve something you need to commit to a certain output like publishing a post every week.

Keep in mind that ouput differs from goals since we control all the variables. A goal for a blog would be to get 500 subscribers over which you have no control.

Getting a promotion is a goal, you don't control it. You can however be so good not be ignored.

## Live by the 80/20 rule

80% of the output comes fromm 20% of the input. 

80% of your work is done in 20% of your time. For most people that time is immediately after waking up. Take advantage of this time.

## Delegate the non-essential

Delegate everything you are not world class at or that someone can do in a fraction of time or cost (unless you have to develop a new skill)
