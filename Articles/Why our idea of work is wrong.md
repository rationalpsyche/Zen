# Why our idea of work is wrong

Work is so abominable and boring that you can get paid for doing it. And the object of doing this is to make money. And the object of making money, is to go home and enjoy the money that you’ve made. When you got it, you see, "you can buy pleasure".

Naturally, Watts’ definition of work doesn’t apply to every job each one of us does. That said, the underlying theory of the role of work in modern society, though extreme, is largely right.

Biologically, there is no such thing as a set requirement to do a set amount of work. We’re programmed to strive for things and to struggle for survival, which itself is one definition of work, but overall, **the concept of sacrificing time for money is a cultural construct**.

We’ve created arbitrary distinctions to keep the economic machine running, which isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s **forced a mental contrast** between the things that we’re supposed to enjoy and the things that we do in order to maintain our ability to do things that we enjoy.

When we think of something as work, we automatically compare it to leisure, and by definition, if it’s the opposite of leisure, we think that it’s not something that gets to be enjoyed.

Even if you have a job that satisfies all of your criteria for keeping you engaged and excited, this **ingrained narrative that you’re “working”** when you’re doing that thing **causes you to see your tasks and your demands as things that are enforced on you rather than chosen**.

Choice is an essential requirement in humans for a feeling of motivation and control, and our distinction of certain commitments as work completely strips that away from us.

Given that we all have to make a living and that doing so is going to demand a big chunk of our time, it’s valuable to think of ways that we can make this time as pleasant as possible. How? **Gamification**.

Nothing in the world is inherently interesting. **Things are interesting because we take the time and effort to make them interesting**. If you have a fluid definition of work and leisure, then much of the time you can turn whatever the job is into play by gamifying it.

If you practice a kind of presence about being where you are rather than waiting to get out of a task in the near future, and if you design the circumstances around your demands to be somewhat challenging, then there is no reason that you can’t enjoy the time that pays you.
