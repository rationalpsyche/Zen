# Learn from failure

## Ray Dalio

*...the popular picture of success - which is like a glossy photo of an ideal man or woman out of a Ralph Lauren catalog, with a bio attached listing all of their accomplishments like going to the best prep schools and an Ivy League college, and getting all the answers right on tests - is an inaccurate picture of the typical successful person.*

*Great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and figuring out how to get around them. So I learned that the people who make the most of the process of encountering reality, especially the painful obstacles, learn the most and get what they want faster than people who do not. I learned that they are the great ones - the ones I wanted to have around me.*

## George Soros

*On a personal level, I am a very critical person who looks for defects in myself as well as in others. But, being so critical, I am also quite forgiving. I couldn't recognize my mistakes if I couldn't forgive myself. To others, being wrong is a source of shame; to me, recognizing my mistakes is a source of pride. Once we realize that **imperfect understanding is the human condition, there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes**.*

## Pain and gain

The idea is to:

* Recognize mistakes 
* Learning from them

Ok but looking at your own mistakes is **painful**

*I call the pain that comes from looking at yourself and others objectively 'growing pains', because it is the pain that accompanies personal growth. No pain, no gain.*

The idea is to **associate pain with long term payoffs**.

When we see people doing amazing things - lifting a thousand pounds, making a million dollars in a single trade, walking on tightropes - we tend to forget that **they didn't start that way**.

Like the rest of us, they started small.

*Treat your life like a game or a martial art. Your mission is to figure out how to get around your challenges to get to your goals. In the process of playing the game or practicing this martial art, you will become more skilled. As you get better, you will progress to ever-higher levels of the game that will require - and teach you - greater skills.*

*Once you accept that playing the game will be uncomfortable, and you do it for a while, it will become much easier (like it does when getting fit). When you excel at it, you will find your ability to get what you want thrilling.*

Remember that simple games are not satisfying. What is more complex than life?
