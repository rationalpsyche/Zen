## Alain de Botton
"...rather than letting every case of opposition or neglect wound us, we are invited **first to examine the justice of others' behaviour**. Only that which is both damning and true should be allowed to shatter our esteem. We should **halt the masochistic process whereby we seek the approval of people before we have asked ourselves whether their views deserve to be listened to**..."


## Schopenhauer
"...when we come to see how superficial and futile are most peopleâ€™s thoughts, how narrow their ideas, how mean their sentiments, how perverse their opinions, and how much of error there is in most of them; when we learn by experience with what depreciation a man will speak of his fellow, when he is not obliged to fear him, or thinks that what he says will not come to his ears. And if ever we have had an opportunity of seeing how the greatest of men will meet with nothing but slight from half-a-dozen blockheads, we shall understand that to lay great value upon what other people say is to pay them too much honor."


## Seneca

"Spend your time with those who will improve you; extend a welcome to those you can improve. The effect is reciprocal, for people learn while teaching."
