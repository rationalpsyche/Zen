# Habit 4 - Think Win Win

## Six paradigms of human interaction

### Win/Win

Win/Win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. With a Win/Win solution all parties feel good about the decision.

Most people tend to think in terms of dichotomies: strong or weak, win or lose. But that kind of thinking is fundamentally flawed. It is based on power and position rather than on principle. Win/Win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person's success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others.

### Win/Lose

In leadership style Win/Lose is the authoritarian approach: "I get my way, you don't get yours". Win/Lose people are prone to use position, power, credentials, possessions, or personality to get their way.

Most people have been scripted in the Win/Lose mentality since birth. In family when a child is compared to another. In the peer group, a child wants acceptance from his parents and then from his peers, whether they be sibling or friends.
The academic world reinforces Win/Lose scripting. Another agent is law. We live in a litigious society. The first thing many people think about when they get into trouble is suing someone, taking them to court, "winning" at someone else's expenses.

### Lose/Win

Some people are programmed the other way: Lose/Win.

"Go ahead, have your way with me"
"I'm a peacemaker. I'll do anything to keep peace"

Lose/Win is worse than Win/Lose because it has no standards, no demands, no expectations, no vision.

Win/Lose people love Lose/Win people because they can feed on them. The problem is that Lose/Win people bury a lot of feelings.

### Lose/Lose

When two Win/Lose people get together - that is when two determined, stubborn, ego invested individuals interact - the result will be Lose/Lose.

Example. Divorce where the husband sell a $100k car for 50 just to give 25 to the wife.

### Win

Another common alternative is simply to think Win. People with the Win mentality don't necessarily want someone else to lose.
That's irrelevant. What matters is that they get what they want.

### Win/Win or No deal

No deal means that if we can't find a solution that would benefit us both we agree to disagree agreeably. No expectations have been created, no performance contracts established.
When you have No Deal as an option in mind you feel liberated because you have no need to manipulate people.

## Five dimensions of Win/Win

Character, relationships, agreements, supportive systems and processes

### Character

Character is the foundation of Win/Win. There are three character traits essential to the Win/Win paradigm.

**Integrity**. We have already defined integrity as the value we place on ourselves. Habits 1,2 and 3 help us develop and maintain integrity. As we clearly identify values and proactively organize and execute around those values on a daily basis we develop self awareness and independent will by making and keeping meaningful promises and commitments.

**Maturity.** Maturity is *the balance between courage and consideration*. Hrand Saxenien defined emotional maturity in a simple, practical and profound definiton: *the ability to express one's own feelings and convictions balanced with consideration for the thoughts and feelings of others*.

Many people think in dichotomies, in either/or terms. They think if you are nice you are not tough. But Win/Win is nice and tough.

**Abundance Mentality.** The paradigm that there is plenty out there for everybody.

### Relationships

What if you have to work out an agreement with someone who hasn't heard of Win/Win and is deeply scripted in Win/Lose? Dealing with Win/Lose is the real test of Win/Win. In this case the relationship is the key. The place to focus is on your circle of Influence. You stay longer in the communication process, you listen more, you express yourself with greater courage. You keep hammering out until the other person begins to realize that you genuinely want the resolution to be a real win for both of you.

It is important to realize that not all decisions need to be Win/Win, again the key is the relation ship.

### Agreements

Win/Win agreements between employers and employees, between independent people working together, etc.

In the Win/Win agreement the following five methods are made very explicit:

* *Desired results* (not methods): identify what is to be done and when
* *Guidelines* specify the parameters (principles, policies, etc.) within which the results are to be accomplished
* *Resources* identify the human, financial, technical or organizational support
* *Accountability* sets up the standards of performance and the time of evaluation
* Consequences* specify what does and will happen as a result of the evaluation

### Systems

Win/Win can only survive in an organization when the systems support it. If you talk Win/Win but you reward Win/Lose you have a losing  program. You get what you reward.

So often the problem is in the system, not in the people. If you put good people in bad systems you get bad results.

### Processes

There is no way to achieve Win/Win ends with Win/Lose means.
Separate the person from the problem, focus on interests and not on positions, invent options for mutual gain.

1. See the problem from the other point of view
2. Identify the key issues and concerns involved
3. Determine what results would constitute a fully acceptable solution
4. Identify new options to achieve those results
