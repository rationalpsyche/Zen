# Inside Out

## Paradigms

A paradigm is a term used to mean a model, a theory, perception or assumption.
We can think of a paradigm as a map. We all know that *the map is not the territory*.
A map is simply an explanation of certain aspects of the territory. That's exactly what a paradigm is.

Suppose you want to reach a destination in a city but you have the wrong map and you are unaware of it because of a mistake in the label. Can you imagine the frustration, the ineffectivenes of trying to reach your destination?

You might work on your *behaviour* - you could try harder, double your speed but you would only arrive in the wrong place faster.

You might work on your *attitude* - you could think positively but still you would not get to the right place.

The point is, you would still be lost because the fundamental problem has nothing to do with behaviour or attitude. It has everything to do with having a wrong map.

If you have the right map then behaviour and attitude make a difference but the first and most important requirement is the accuracy of the map.

Each of us has many maps in our head which can be divided in two main categories:

* maps of *the way things are* or *realities*
* maps of *the way things should be* or *values*

We interpret everything we experience through these mental maps, we seldom question their accuracy, we are usually even unaware that we have them.

We simply *assume* that the way we see things is the way they really are of the way the should be.

And our attitudes and behaviours grow out of these assumptions. The way we see things is the source of how we think and act.

Example: picture of the woman

## Paradigm shift

The term *paradigm shift* was introduced by Thomas Kuhn in *The structure of scientific revolutions*.
Almost every significant breakthrough in the field of scientific endeavor is first a break with tradtion, with old ways of thinking, with old paradigms.

Example: the earth at the center of the universe, then the sun at center. The Newtonian model of physics then completed by the Einstein paradigm.


## The principle-centered paradigm

The Character-Ethic is based on the fundamental idea that there are *principles* that govern human effectiveness, natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real as gravity in the physical dimension.

Principles are not specific to any faith or religion and can be easily validated by any individual.

Examples: fairness, integrity, honesty, human dignity.

Principles are not *practices*. A practice is a specific activity or action. A practice that works in one circumstance will not necessarily work in another, as parents who have tried to raise a second child exactly like they did the first can readily attest.

Principles are not *values*. A gang of thieves can share values but they are in violation of the fundamental principles.

The more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles or natural laws the more accurate and functional they will be.

## Habits and effectiveness

We define a habit as the intersection of *knowledge*, *skill* and *desire*.

Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the *what to do* and *why*. Skill is the *how to do*. And desire is motivation, *want to do*.

The seven habits are habits of *effectiveness* because they are based on a principle called P/PC balance (production/production capability).

The principle can be understood remembering Aesop's fable of the goose and the golden egg.

Most people see effectiveness from the golden egg paradigm: the more you produce, the more you do, the more effective you are.
But as the story shows true effectiveness is a function of what is produced (the golden eggs) and the production asset or capacity to produce (the goose).

If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the goose you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs.

On the other hand if you focus on the goose with no aim towards the golden eggs you won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose.

There are three kind of assets: physical, financial and human.

## What can you expect

*"No one can persuade another to change. Each of us guards a gate of change that can only be opened from the inside. We cannot open a gate of another, either by argument or by emotional appeal"*
