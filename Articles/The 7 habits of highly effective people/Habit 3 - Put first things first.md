# Habit 3 - Put First Things First

Habit 1 says "You are the creator, you are in charge". It is based on the four human endowments of *imagination*, *conscience*, *independent will* and *self awareness*.

Habit 2 is the first or mental creation. 

Habit 3 is the second creation, the physical creation.

Effective management is *putting first things first*. While leadership decides what "first things" are, it is management that puts them first.

"The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don't like to do. They don't like doing them either necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose".

## Four generations of time management

The first generation could be characterized by notes and checklists.

The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books. This wave reflects an attempt to look ahead, to schedule events and activities in the future.

The third generation adds to those preceding generations the important idea of prioritization. It focuses on setting goals (long, intermediate and short term). It also includes the concept of daily planning.

While the third generation has made a significant contribution, people have begun to realize that "efficient" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive. The efficiency focus creates expectations that clash with the opportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs and enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis.

There is a fourth generation that is different in kind. It recognizes that the challenge is not to manage time but to manage ourselves. Rather than focusing on *things* and *time* the fourth generation focuses on preserving and enhancing *relationships* and on accomplishing *results*, in short on maintaining the P/PC balance.
