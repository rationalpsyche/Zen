## The emotional bank account

An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor that describes the amount of trust that has been built up in a relationship. It is the feeling of safeness you have with another human being.

If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank Account with you through courtsy, kindness, honesty and keeping my commitments I build up a reserve. Your trust towards me become higher. I can make mistakes and my trust level will compensate for it.

But if I have a habit of showing discourtesy, disrespect, cutting you off, overreacting, ignoring you, betraying your trust, threatening you eventually my Emotional Bank Account is overdrawn. Then I am walking on mine fields.

### Six Major Deposits

* **Understanding the individual**

	What might be a deposit for you - going for a walk, working on common projects, etc. - might not be perceived by someone else as a deposit at all.

	You may be working on a high priority project when your six year old child interrupts with something that seems trivial to you but it may be very important from his point of view.

* **Attending to the little things**

	In relationships the little things are the big things.

* **Keeping commitments**

	Keeping a commitment or a promise is a major deposit; breaking one is a major withdrawal.

* **Clarifying expectations**

	We create negative situations by simply assuming that our expectations are self evident and that they are clearly understood and shared by other people.
	The deposit is to make the expectations clear and explicit in the beginning. 

* **Showing personal integrity**

	Personal integrity generates trust and is the basis of many different kind of deposits.
	Integrity includes but goes beyond honesty. 

	Honesty is telling the truth - in other words *conforming our words to reality*. Integrity is *conforming reality to our words* (keeping promises and fulfilling expectations).

	One way to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those who are not present. In doing so we build the trust of those who are present.

* **Apoligizing sincerely when you make a withdrawal**

## P problems are PC opportunities

Example. When parents see their children's problem as opportunities to build the relationship instead of as negative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of parent child interaction.
