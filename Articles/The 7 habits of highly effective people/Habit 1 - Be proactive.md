# Habit 1 - Be proactive

We are not our feelings, we are not our moods and not even our thoughts. The very fact that we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world. Self-awareness enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we see ourselves.

## The social mirror

The vision we have of ourselves should not come from the social mirror - from the current social paradigm and from the opinions, perceptions and paradigms of people around us.

* "You are never on time"
* "Why can't you keep things in order?"
* "You eat like a horse"
* "I can't believe you won"
* "This is so simple, why can't you understand"

These visions are often more projections than reflections, projecting the concerns and character weaknesses of people giving the input.

We are largely determined by conditioning and conditions (think about the example of the drawing of the woman).

There are three social maps to explain the nature of man:

* **Genetic determinism:** *your grandparents did it to you*

	You grandparents had short tempers and it's in your DNA. In addition you are Irish and it is the nature of Irish people.

* **Psychic determinism:** *your parents did it to you*

	Your upbringing, your childhood experience essentially laid out your character structure.

* **Environmental determinism:** *your boss is doing it to you*

	or your spouse, or your economic situation or national policies.

Each of these maps is based on the stimulus-response theory.

## Between Stimulus and Response

Recall example of Frankl in the concentration camps.

In addition to *self-awareness* we have *imagination*, the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality. We have *conscience*, a deep inner awareness of right and wrong. We have *independet will*, the ability to act based on our self-awareness.

Between stimulus and response is our greatest power - the freedom to choose.

## "Proactivity" defined

Proactivity means more than merely taking initiative. It means that as human beings we are responsible for our lives. Our behaviour is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to values.

Look at the word *responsibility - "response-ability"* - the ability to choose your response.

**Proactive people** recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions or conditioning for their behaviour.

**Reactive people** are often affected by their physical environment. If the weather is good they feel good. If it isn't it affects their attitude and performance. Proactive people can carry their own weather with them.
Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the "social weather".
Reactive people build their emotional lives around the behaviour of others, empowering the weaknesses of other people to control them.


The ability to **subordinate an impulse to a value** is the essence of a proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values.

It is not what happens to us but our response to what happens to us that hurts us.

## Listening to our language

Our language is a very real indicator of the degree to which we see ourselves as proactive people.

The language of proactive people absolves them of responsibility.

* "That's me. That's just the way I am". I am determined, there is nothing I can do about it
* "He makes me so mad". I am not responsible. My emotional life is governed by something outside my control
* "I can't do that. I just don't have the time". Something outside me - limited time - is controlling me
* "If only my wife wre more patient". Someone else's behaviour is limiting my effectiveness.
* "I have to do it". Circumstances or other people are forcing me to do what I do. I am not free to choose my own actions

| Reactice Language | Proactive Language |
| --- | --- |
| There is nothing I can do | Let's look at our alternatives |
| That's just the way I am | I can choose a different approach |
| He makes me so mad | I control my own feelings |
| They won't allow that | I can create an effective presentation |
| I have to do that | I will choose an appropriate response |
| I can't | I choose |
| I must | I prefer |
| If only | I will |

In the great literature of all progressive societies, love is a verb. Reactive people make it a feeling. Hollywood has generally scripted us to believe that we are not responsible, that we are a product of our feelings. But the Hollywood script does not describe reality.

Proactive people make love a verb. Love is something you do: the sacrifices you make, the giving of self, like a mother bringing a newborn in the world. Love is a value that is actualized through loving actions.

## Circle of concern and Circle of Influence

There are some things over which we have no control, these belong to the circle of concerns.

There are others for which we can do something about, they belong to the circle of influence.

Proactive people focus their efforts in the circle of influence while reactive people in the circle of concern.

The circle of concern is filled with *have's*:

* I'll be happy *when I have* my house paid off
* *If only I had* a boss who wasn't such a dictator
* *If only I had* a more patient husband
* *If I had* more obedient kids
* *If I could just have* more time to myself

The circle of influence is filled with the *be's*: I can *be* more patient, *be* wise, *be* loving.

Anytime we think the problem is out there **that thought is the problem**. We empower what is out there to control us. The change paradigm is outside-in.

The proactive approach is to change from inside out: to *be* different and by being different to effect positive change in what is out there.

Example: Joseph who was sold into slavery
