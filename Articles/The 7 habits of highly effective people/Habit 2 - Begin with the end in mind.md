# Habit 2 - Begin with the end in mind

The most fundamental application of "Begin with the end in mind" is to begin today with the image, picture or paradim or the end of your life as your frame of reference by which everything else is examined.

It means to start of clear understanding of your destination.
It is incredibly easy to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it is leaning against the wrong wall.

If you carefully consider what you wanted to be said of you on the day of your funeral you will find your definition of success.

## All things are created twice

There is a mental or first creation and a physical or second creation to all things.

Most business failures begin in the first creation, with problems such as undercapitalization, misunderstanding of the market or lack of a business plan.

The same is true with parenting. If you want to raise responsible self-disciplined children you have to keep that end in mind as you interact with your children on a daily basis.

## By design or default

All things are created twice but not all first creations are by conscious design. If we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstances to shape much of our lives by default. **We reactively live the scripts handed to us by family, associates, other people's agenda**.

Self-awareness enables us to take charge of our own first creation. Put another way, Habit 1 says "Your are the creator". Habit 2 is the first creation.

## Leadership and management

Leadership is the first creation. Management is the second.

*"Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things"*

Efficient management without effective leadership is "like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic". No management success can compensate for failure in leadership. But leadership is hard because **we are often caught in a management paradigm**.

Parents can get trapped in the management paradigm, thinking of control, efficiency and rules instead of direction, purpose and family feeling.

And leadership is even more lacking in our personal lives. We are into managing with efficiency, setting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values.

We often get caught up in the "thick of thin things". What matters most gets buried under layers of pressing problems, immediate concerns and outward behaviours.

## A personal mission statement

An effective way to begin with the end in mind is to develop a *personal mission statement*.

It focuses on what you want be (character) and to do (contributions and achievements) and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are based.

Example of personal mission statement

* Never compromise with honesty.
* Hear both sides before judging.
* Maintain a positive attitude.
* Do not fear mistakes - fear the absence of corrective response to those mistakes
* Listen twice as much as you speak.

You could call a personal mission statement a personal constitution. It is fundamentally changeless.

People can't live change if there is not a changeless core inside them. The key to the ability to change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value.

## At the center

In order to write a personal mission statement we must begin at the very center of our circle of influence.

Whatever is at the center of our life will be the source of our *security*, *guidance*, *wisdom* and *power*.

* *Security* represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength

* *Guidance* means your source of direction in life, your internal frame of reference

* *Wisdom* is your perspective on life, your sense of balance

* *Power* is the strength to accomplish something.

These four factors are interdependent. Security and clear guidance bring true wisdom and wisdom becomes the spark to release and direct power.

## Alternative centers

Each of us has a center. Here are some common ones.

* Spouse

	If our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from marriage then we become highly dependent upon that relationship.

* Family

	This center may too seem natural and proper. Consider such parents who live with this center: the need to be popular with their children may override the importance of a long term investment in the children's growth and development.

* Money
* Work
* Possession
* Pleasure
* Self

It is much easier to recognize someone else's center than our own.
