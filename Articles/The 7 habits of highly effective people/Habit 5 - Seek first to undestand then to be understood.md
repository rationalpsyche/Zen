# Habit 5 - Seek first to understand, then to be understood

Suppose you go to an optometrist for help. After briefly listening to your complaint he takes off his glasses and hands them to you.

"Put these on. I've worn these pair of glasses for ten years now and tehy have really helped me. I have an extra pair at home, you can wear these."

"This is terrible, I can't see a thing"

"What's wrong? They work great for me. Try harder"

"I can not see anything"

"You are so ungrateful, after all I've done to help you"

What are the chances you would go back to that optometrist the next time you needed help? You don't have much confidence in someone who doesn't diagnose before he prescribes.

We have such a tendency to rush in, to fix things up with good advice. But we often fail to take the time to diagnose, to really deeply understand the problem first.

## Character and communication

Communication is the most important skill in life. We spend most of our waking hours communicating. But consider this: you've spent years learning how to read and write, years learning how to speak. But what about listening?

## Empathic listening

"Seek first to understand" involves a very deep shift in paradigm. We typically seek first to be understood. Most people do not listen with the intent to understand, they listen with the intent to reply. They are reading their autobiography into other people's lives.

"Oh I know exactly how you feel"

"I went through the very same thing, let me tell you about my experience" 

They prescribe their own glasses for everyone with whom they interact.

When another person speaks we're usually "listening" at one of four levels. We may be *ignoring* another person, not really listening at all. We may practice *pretending*. "Yeah, uh-huh. Right.". We may practice *selective listening*, hearing only certain parts of the conversation. Or we may practice *attentive listening*, paying attention on the words being said. But very few of us ever practice the fifth level, *empathic listening*, listening with intent to understand.

Empathic listening is a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account. It's deeply therapeutic and healing because it gives a person "psychological air".
If all the air were suddenly sucked out of the room you are in right now, what would happen to your interest in this book? You wouldn't care about the book, you wouldn't care about anything except getting air. Survival would be your only motivation.

But now that you have air it doesn't motivate you. *Satisfied needs do not motivate*. Next to physical survival the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival: to be understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated.

When you listen with empathy to another person you give that person psychological air.

## Diagnose before you prescribe

A good engineer will understand the forces, the stresses at work, before designing the bridge. A good teacher will assess the class before teaching. A good student will understand before he applies. A good parent will understand before evalutating or judging.

## Four autobiographical responses

Because we listen autobiographically we tend to respond in one of four ways. We *evaluate* - we either agree or disagree; we *probe* - we ask questions from our own frame of reference; we *advise* - we give counsel based on our own experience; or we *interpret* - we try to figure people out, to explain their motives, their behaviour, based on our own motives, our own behaviours.

There are four developmental stages in emphatic listening.
The first and least effective is to *mimic content*. 

"Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds"

"You've had it. You think school is for the birds".

You have essentially repeated back the content of what was being sad. You haven't evaluated or probed or advised or interpreted. You have at least shown you are paying attention to his words.

The second stage is to *rephrase the content*. 

"Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds"

"You don't want to go to school anymore"

This time you've put meaning into your own words. Now you're thinking about what he said, mostly with the left side, the logical side of the brain.

The third stage involves your right brain into operation. You *reflect feeling*. 

"Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds"

"You're really frustrated"

The fourth stage involves both the second and the third. Yo *rephrase the content and reflect the feeling*.

"Dad, I've had it! School is for the birds"

"You're really frustrated about school"

Frustration is the feeling, school is the content.

## Then seek to be understood

The early Greeks had a magnificent philosophy which is embedded in three sequentially arranged words: *ethos*, *pathos*, *logos*. These three words contain the essence of seeking first to understand then to be understood.

*Ethos* is your personal credibility, the faith people have in your integrity and competence. It's the trust you inspire, your emotional bank account.

*Pathos* is the empathic side, it's the feeling. It means you are in alignment with the emotional thrust of another person's communication. *Logos* is the logic, the reasoning part of your communication.

Most people, in making presentations, go straight to the logos.
