# Find time to learn

Everyone has 24 hours. What matters is how you spend time.

There are four kinds of things you can spend time on:

|               | Urgent |       Not Urgent     |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------  |
| Important     |    1   |      2 (focus here!) |
| Not Important |    3   |      4     |

* Quadrant 1: e.g. work-related things with a deadline

* Quadrant 2: learning is often here

* Quadrant 3: you want to reduce them e.g. keep up with twitter

* Quadrant 4: you don't want to do them if possible

## What are our priorities?

* Cut time from activities that are not important

	Don't work overtime at a job you hate. That's time in Quadrant 3 because the work doesn't help you get to where you want to be.

* Focus on what you learn

	Learn what is important to get you to the next stage. 
	Other things can wait.

* Block out time for learning
